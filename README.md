# DVM-Task-2
Second Task for DVM Recruitment
My site views best in Firefox at 100% magnification at full screen view
I tried to make it responsive but was unable to do it perfectly as it leaves white spaces vertically when screen size is reduced.
Other than that, I've made a homepage which has a link to the registrations page and a "Contact Us" page. The navbar is fully functional and leads to different sites in clicking on the photo or any of the three options.
Also, the form on registrations page shows error if-  1. Phone number is not of 10 digits   2. BITS ID is not in valid format    3. Bits E-mail is not in valid format   4. End-date is before the start date.
Likewise,the form on contact us page also shows error if-   1. Phone number is not of 10 digits   2. BITS ID is not in valid format
