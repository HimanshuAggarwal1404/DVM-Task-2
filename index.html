                <p>Over the years the Birla Institute Of Technology And Science, Pilani has built and maintained a
                    reputation of imparting the right mix of education, experience, and ethics that form the basis for

                    zenith of science, engineering, and path-breaking technology in a landscape of future visionaries,
                    scientists, corporate bigwigs, and inventors. From paper presentations and guest lectures on one
                    hand to debates, quizzes, and cultural nights on the other, APOGEE is playing host to a gamut of
                    activities giving you the opportunity to interact with the brightest minds in the country.</p>
